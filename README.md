Hi yaaaa!!!

Worry not about random number generation, I already did that.

This is just a simple package, it generates random number for you and can be used in your projects.


How to use?
    npm install damicode-num-generator
and then? 
    import <damicode-generator> from 'damicode-number-generator'
NOTE:
    <damicode-generator> can be replaced by anything of your choice.


Happy coding!
